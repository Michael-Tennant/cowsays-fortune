"Laundry:\n" + 
"	Women do laundry every couple of days.  A man will wear every article\n" + 
"of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight\n" + 
"years ago, before he will do his laundry.  When he is finally out of clothes,\n" + 
"he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain\n" + 
"of clothes to the laundromat.  Men always expect to meet beautiful women at\n" + 
"the laundromat.  This is a myth.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Nicknames:\n" + 
"	If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah and Michelle get together for lunch,\n" + 
"they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah and Michelle.  But if\n" + 
"Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately\n" + 
"refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut Brain and Useless.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Socks:\n" + 
"	Men wear sensible socks.  They wear standard white sweatsocks.\n" + 
"Women wear strange socks.  They are cut way below the ankles, have pictures\n" + 
"of clouds on them, and have a big fuzzy ball on the back.\n",

"	Friends were surprised, indeed, when Frank and Jennifer broke their\n" + 
"engagement, but Frank had a ready explanation: \"Would you marry someone who\n" + 
"was habitually unfaithful, who lied at every turn, who was selfish and lazy\n" + 
"and sarcastic?\"\n" + 
"	\"Of course not,\" said a sympathetic friend.\n" +

"			-- Gifts for Men --\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Men are amused by almost any idiot thing -- that is why professional ice\n" + 
"hockey is so popular -- so buying gifts for them is easy.  But you should\n" + 
"never buy them clothes.  Men believe they already have all the clothes they\n" + 
"will ever need, and new ones make them nervous.  For example, your average\n" + 
"man has 84 ties, but he wears, at most, only three of them.  He has learned,\n" + 
"through humiliating trial and error, that if he wears any of the other 81\n" + 
"ties, his wife will probably laugh at him (\"You're not going to wear THAT\n" + 
"tie with that suit, are you?\"). So he has narrowed it down to three safe\n" + 
"ties, and has gone several years without being laughed at.  If you give him\n" + 
"a new tie, he will pretend to like it, but deep inside he will hate you.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"If you want to give a man something practical, consider tires.  More than\n" + 
"once, I would have gladly traded all the gifts I got for a new set of tires.\n" +

"\`\`Lasu'' Wirzenius today released the 0.3 edition of the \`\`Linux System\n" + 
"Administrators' Guide''.  Already an industry non-classic, the new\n" +

"would be futile, if it weren't for the SAG,'' says Matt Welsh, director\n" + 
"of LDP, Inc.\n" + 
"	The new version is still distributed freely, now even with a\n" +

"Helsinki several times this year.  Despite of this, Linus Torvalds,\n" +

"	Several researchers at the University of Louisiana have been studying\n" + 
"the computing power of various amphibians, frogs in particular.  The problem\n" + 
"of frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas\n" + 
"of computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-\n" + 
"bian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size\n" + 
"pond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that\n" + 
"there is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program\n" +

"	There are few bad musicians who have a chance to give a recital at\n" +

"instrument.  This happened about thirty years ago to the son of a Rumanian\n" +

"violinist.  Enesco agreed to give lessons to the son who was quite\n" + 
"unhampered by great musical talent.\n" + 
"	Three years later the boy's father insisted that he give a public\n" + 
"concert.  \"His aunt said that nobody plays the violin better than he does.\n" + 
"A cousin heard him the other day and screamed with enthusiasm.\"  Although\n" + 
"Enesco feared the consequences, he arranged a recital at the Salle Gaveau\n" + 
"in Paris.  However, nobody bought a ticket since the soloist was unknown.\n" + 
"	\"Then you must accompany him on the piano,\" said the boy's father,\n" + 
"\"and it will be a sell out.\"\n" + 
"	Reluctantly, Enesco agreed and it was.  On the night an excited\n" +

"	In the audience was Alfred Cortot, the brilliant pianist, who\n" + 
"volunteered and made his way to the stage.\n" + 
"	The soloist was of uniformly low standard and next morning the\n" + 
"music critic of Le Figaro wrote: \"There was a strange concert at the Salle\n" + 
"Gaveau last night.  The man whom we adore when he plays the violin played\n" +
